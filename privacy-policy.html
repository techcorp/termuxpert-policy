    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="small">
      Last updated: {{2026}}.  
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Technical Corp</strong> ("we", "our", "us")
      handles information in the <strong>TermuXpert</strong> mobile application ("App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      TermuXpert is designed to respect user privacy.
      We do <strong>not collect, store, or process any personal information</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, we do not collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Account credentials</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No Account or Registration</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not require user registration or account creation.
      You can use all features without providing any personal details.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      TermuXpert may display advertisements using third-party services such as AdMob.
      These third-party providers may collect limited, non-personal data
      as required to serve ads, in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technical Corp does not control and is not responsible for
      how third-party services handle data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use of Security Tools</h2>
    <p>
      The App provides educational information related to Termux and cybersecurity tools.
      All tools and techniques are intended for learning and authorized testing only.
      We do not monitor, log, or track user activity within the App.

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      TermuXpert does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
      Since the App does not collect personal data, there is no intentional data processing
      related to children.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      As no personal data is collected or stored,
      there is no risk of personal data exposure from our systems.

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
